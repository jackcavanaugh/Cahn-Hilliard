# Cahn-Hilliard
Phase-field simulation of the Cahn-Hilliard equation in two-dimensions applying an explicit finite-difference method with periodic boundary conditions. 

Originally coded in MATLAB in 2016. Primary purpose of this project is to convert to Python, consider opportunities for optimization as a learning experience, and explore solution space.
